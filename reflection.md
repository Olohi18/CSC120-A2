Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment. 

What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

I learned a whole lot of new concepts, strategies, and lessons from this assignment.

Although I started the assignment early, about a day after it was assigned, I used certain approaches that weren't really helpful, like compelling myself to understand every bit of the code and not strategically using the time I alloted to doing the assignment.

I also learned to at least, understand where I'm at before goung to meet the tutors. Although they are a helpful resource, it's challenging to make progress when you don't know the right questions to ask them.

Out of confusion from the mistake I made going for tutoring confused about which questions to ask, I had to restart the assignment on the due date, Wednesday, February 07, 2024, and it took me roughly three hours ot complete it. I need help with the update_price and refurbish methods as they took most of my time but just still won't run. The interpreter keeps telling me ".Computer object" not subscriptable, or cannot be assigned.

I felt bad having to ask for help on the Discord group chat cos the assignment was past its due date, so I just commented that part out. I'll be going for office hours to resolve this issue, and will revise my assignment then.

My advice to anyone taking this course is to not see the assignment as a mountain. It's wayyyy easier than it looks and with the right help, you'll be good. Also, be wise going for tutoring. If you don't have the right questions to ask, you might end up confusing yourself and the tutor, and it's not your fault or that of the tutors. Life happens!

Thanks Jordan! Thanks Johannna! You guys are awesome!
